# exec-bat-anything-from-any-protonprefix

So I never have to leave the comfort of Steam / Proton.

Replace the game's main executable with an identically named copy of wine's cmd.exe, put the exec.bat next to it, run the game from Steam, and type exec, now you can run whatever you want with that.

Enjoy!
