work in progress

# Todo

- Stuff.

...

- Many, many other things not listed here.

# Platforms

The game officially runs on Windows 10, Linux, & Haiku.

If you have an operating system that isn't any of those, it could work, but you're on your own for getting it set up, and it may not function properly at all. Beware.

# how to (win10)

Game is only tested on the latest versions of Windows 10 and depends on it.

It requires Windows 10 build 17063 or later.

Run the following commands inside of Git Bash in order to download and start the game.

Required dependencies are: Git Bash (https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases), and Microsoft's modern 'Windows Terminal' (from the Microsoft Store, unless you are using LTSC, where the game has a launcher to download that Terminal for you.)

```git clone https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/textadv.sh```

```cd textadv.sh```

```cmd "/C run-win-zoey.bat"```

(OR if you are on LTSC, this command instead:)

```cmd "/C run-win-LTSC-enterprise.bat"```

# how to (linux)

Run the following commands inside of your bash terminal emulator in order to download and start the game.

Required dependencies are: Bash, and a Terminal Emulator.

```git clone https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/textadv.sh```

```cd textadv.sh```

```bash textadv.sh```

# how to (haiku)

Run the following commands inside of 'Terminal' in order, to download and start the game.

Required dependencies are: bash, git. You can make sure you have them by searching for them in HaikuDepot. (look for Status: Active on them)

```bash```

```git clone https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/textadv.sh```

```cd textadv.sh```

```bash textadv.sh```

# how to (mac)

Try as I might, I could not get the game working properly on the only Mac I have, which runs Mac OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard.
Given I am only going to use that version of OS X at the highest, ever, because everything after it sucked, I won't be able to support Mac with this game.
I could not get the colour codes used inside of the game to render on Mac, it was just spewing their code directly into the Terminal.
If YOU know what I don't, and could offer insight into how to get it working, let me know, and I'd happily test it myself and then provide official instructions.

# The game has an updater. To update the game to the latest version, simply run the following command when in-game: dev update
