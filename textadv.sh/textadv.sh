# NOTABLE DEV NOTE: make an auto-updater for the game, that works on both Win and Lin.
# make it nuke all the files, and fully download a new version fresh.
# because then, mon amour will have a much happier better time working on this with me.

# Character #1
# Evelyn:
#
# DEV NOTE: add a neko catgirl maid to the game, make particular mention of her
#  cat ears, tail, and other cat features, etc. her name is Evelyn.
#
# she is white.
#
# she has red (as in, apple, not ginger) hair [as in, around #9a4447] which flows down her back to around butt level
# and also surrounds her face, flowing down to just below shoulder level, green eyes, 
# a collar with bell, cat ears with fluff.
#
# she has black cat whiskers.
#
# a little adorable red bow under her collar, too.
#
# she loves headpats. she's 23, like me.
#
# she is 5 foot 4.
#
# she's not fat. 
# you'd not even call her chubby. she isn't thin. but she's not too chubby at all. a healthy weight.
# she's 135 lbs.
#
# she's positive and happy generally, unless it's appropriate that she not be. 
# not overly so, she's just good mindset. smiles often.
# 
# of course she wears the traditional maid dress.
#
# get real HD art of her commissioned some day, based on the descriptions you will write for her in the game.
