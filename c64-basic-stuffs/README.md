c64-basic-stuffs

on the 29th of january 2022 at 21:45pm, i decided that i'd like to learn and use C64 basic

within just under an hour i'd already made a first script, so here's a repo for me to put all my basic that i write

repo for basic that i write.

i'm brand new to basic, but it shares some things with Batch, which i'm quite familiar with

i am writing for and testing all my basic in vice x64 c64 emulator- i use gedit for actual code editing

## running a script

ensure caps lock is off, 

open vice x64 c64 emulator, 

copy the entire script text in full with ctrl+a, ctrl+c, 

then go to the edit > paste in vice, 

press enter, & enter run

should be working

*some of the scripts automatically type run for you. some of the scripts blank the screen while importing to avoid game spoilers.*
