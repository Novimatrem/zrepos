REQUIRES and DEPENDS UPON ``zenity``, ``espeak``, ``paplay``, ``bash``, and a working ``fortune`` command.

# The alarm currently triggers at a set time by default and there is no simple way to adjust this outside of editing the bash scripts manually in multiple places, at the moment.

# Installation
Clone the contents of this repo into a folder where it will be safely accessible in the future; ``git clone https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/alarm-clock``

I usually place it in; ``/opt/`` making the final path ``/opt/alarm-clock/``. 

**(If you've not already, you will need to take ownership of the ``/opt/`` folder before you can make edits there. To do so, use ``sudo chown $USER /opt/``, and ``sudo chown $USER /opt/*`` commands.)** 

Make a startup program using the "Startup Applications" GUI in which the command is ``bash /path/to/alarm-clock.sh`` (that command usually being ``bash /opt/alarm-clock/alarm-clock.sh``, then restart your computer.

# elementary OS workaround
For sound to play while the system is locked, in elementary OS, you need to run the following command and then reboot the system.

``sudo adduser $(whoami) audio``
