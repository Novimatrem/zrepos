A long time ago, I made a text-adventure game engine in the Batch scripting language, seen here [https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/untitled-batch-game-engine-old-abandoned](https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/untitled-batch-game-engine-old-abandoned) - and today, to get some emotions out, I hacked it into what you see here, a very short, slightly interactive story of a game. Please read the list of content warnings on game start before playing.

This is a short small game I wrote in a language I am no longer too familiar with, in just over 4 hours, when dreadfully tired. Please don't judge it too harshly.

I really need to learn Python, and abandon Batch and my engine fully.

Works on Windows, and on Linux with Wine.
