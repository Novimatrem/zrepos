Launch the launch-fedora.sh shell script to run.
If you don't use Fedora, it will probably still work if you go inside of the script, replace all instances of 'dnf' with the name of your package manager, and run the shell script.

Yes, I know, the code is awful, the way you have to launch it is awful, and it's not fast to use. But it works. This is my first ever proper Python project that actually does anything other than error-out. I do intend to make something better in the future, or to improve this version, but for now, this literally *does* do the job. No matter how inefficiently.

With how the first version of this is, this is very much a case of "works for me". I did some awful horrible hacks to make this work, and it probably won't function unless your window titlebar height is exactly 29 pixels high from outer-edge to the edge of where the arcade window content starts, and your window borders are exactly 1 pixel thick. (I'm using MATE with the GreenLaguna theme).
