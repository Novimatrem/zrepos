### stairs mode

one day i plan to add stairs mode

where you press S, the editor restarts, the words STAIRS MODE appears in the title bar, and you can place a sprite of stairs in a place

to allow for multiple floors

and obviously when i have developed that technology, i can place anything.

because then i'll have sprites placable

i just have to add them like the stairs


# Setup

**1.**
Download the program from here:
[https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/dnd-dungeon-layout-map-maker/-/blob/main/dungeon-maker_v2_WIN.zip](https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/dnd-dungeon-layout-map-maker/-/blob/main/dungeon-maker_v2_WIN.zip)

and extract it to a folder you'll have access to, perhaps My Documents.

**2.**
Go into the directory and install the dependencies in the 0_install-these-first folder, ensuring that you click "Add Python to PATH" and "Disable path length limit" during the Python installer", and that you run the Bat file inside of that folder.

**3.**
Run the launch-windows.bat file to start the application, if you launch it in any other way it will not work.

**4.**
Draw your map! Click to place blocks, and press C to get an option to change block colour.

**Finishing**
After you're done with your map, close the cmd window that the script opened, and the program will go away.
Now simply copy gridback.png (which is your saved map file) into roll20, or Discord, or whatever you wish to do with it.
