REQUIRES and DEPENDS UPON ``pulseaudio``, ``pactl``, ``libnotify-bin`` (``the notify-send command``).

There is a 50% variant in the folder for if 100% is too much on your hardware/preference.

# Installation
Clone the contents of this repo into a folder where it will be safely accessible in the future; ``git clone https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/warning-sound-if-volume-is-100-percent``

I usually place it in; ``/opt/`` making the final path ``/opt/warning-sound-if-volume-is-100-percent/``. 

**(If you've not already, you will need to take ownership of the ``/opt/`` folder before you can make edits there. To do so, use ``sudo chown $USER /opt/``, and ``sudo chown $USER /opt/*`` commands.)** 

Make a startup program using the "Startup Applications" GUI in which the command is ``bash /path/to/warning-sound-if-volume-is-100-percent.sh`` (that command usually being ``bash /opt/warning-sound-if-volume-is-100-percent/warning-sound-if-volume-is-100-percent.sh``, then restart your computer.

# Companion script recommendation
I strongly recommend using this script, in combination with another script of mine, which will limit the volume maximum to 100%, [https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/limit-pulseaudio-max-volume-to-100-percent](https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/limit-pulseaudio-max-volume-to-100-percent)
