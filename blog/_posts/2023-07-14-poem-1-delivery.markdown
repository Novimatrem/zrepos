Recently, after getting into reading more, (currently working my way through Jam by Yahtzee Croshaw again- no spoilers, I've read it before but I forgot what happened), I've thought that I needed to practice my writing, in various ways, more often. A poem is somewhat unrelated, but it was the first thing of these endeavours that I could publish.

(Feel free to read it aloud, if you're alone. Works better that way.)

<br>

A ring, and a knock on the door, it arrives,<br>
Followed by efforts, punctuated by sighs,<br>
A creaking wood doesn't help with the struggle,<br>
nor the lacking of others, it's always just trouble.

It's not unexpected, but rather the task,<br>
is more than enough, for one quite so vast.

With a few toughness filled steps she has risen,<br>
hoping delays would just be forgiven.

Making her slow way across the hard floor,<br>
she reaches a paw to the patterned white door.

It's not to her shock, she's more unsurprised,<br>
that her package has gone, nobody in sight.

She's used to the fact, that nobody will wait,<br>
nor have patience for those who carry such weight.

<br>

...

**That's all for this post, thanks for reading! I wish you a great week.**
