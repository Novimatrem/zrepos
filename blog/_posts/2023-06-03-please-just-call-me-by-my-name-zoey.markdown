Hello.

I've got a few nicknames on the internet, and my username- there's various ways to refer to me by name.

There's Novi, Novimatrem, Novi-chan, among others.

While I do enjoy my username as a username, that's all it is. It is a handle to represent me on the internet.

I would strongly prefer it if you were to refer to me as who I am, with my name, zoey.

That'd just make things more happy and comfortable for me, during communications, and such.

Of course I won't be *offended* if you call me Novi, or Novimatrem, or whatever, that's my username, and *I do* like my username, obviously, that's why I'm called it- it'd just be better for me to be referred to with my real name.

Thanks,<br>
zoey

...

PS: and I know it sounds absurd, but if you type my real name, can you type it in lowercase please, (so,&nbsp;&nbsp;zoey&nbsp;)- that’s more comforting for me, and less distressing. Sorry if that’s odd sounding. The reason is because of past trauma, that I see the "properly-spelled" 'Zoey' as negative and recall things I'd rather forget. So, zoey it is, exclusively.

...

**That's all for this post, thanks for reading! I wish you a great week.**
