I have a question I’d like to ask you to answer that’d help me quite a bit to get answers to, and because I’m bad at combining data from various sources, I put it in the form of a Google Form, basically it’s:

‘What can I [zoey] (Novimatrem) do to be and look more feminine/girly?’

sorry for doing it this way but I am silly and lose track of things, but, it’d be really helpful to get an answer or a few.

Feel free to let me know via alternative methods, if submitting via a Google Form is a problem for you.

This question is coming from a place of worry at the supply of my hormones, and If I was to run out of estrogen.

Please let me know any and all things that come to mind on how I could be, act, look, and appear, more feminine, girly, etc, on the form.

I didn't get the childhood I should've had to teach me all of this. So, please go ahead and answer if you have any ideas that'd help.
