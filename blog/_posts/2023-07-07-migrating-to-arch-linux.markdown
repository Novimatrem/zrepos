It is with great pleasure that I announce that I'm migrating back to Linux, after half a year without it. I will be migrating to Arch Linux, because it works better than Windows in many regards I deem important, now, compared to how it was 6 months ago. I can finally leave Windows once again.

My graphics card (an AMD RX 6700 XT) is **working better on Arch than it does on Windows 10**, now, as it seems the hardware compatibility concerns I was having since Christmas have been resolved, which is why I went with such a bleeding/cutting-edge distro as Arch, to ensure I got this resolved ASAP.

I will be backing up my data and making the move over the coming few days. Glad to be back.
