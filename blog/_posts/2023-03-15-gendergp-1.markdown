Sorry if I'm not quite myself, or too positive right now- they're (GenderGP) are really screwing me around with access to my hormones, both happening now, happening in the next few months, and happening in 9 months time, so, it's just not a good time for me at the moment and I hope I can get it resolved. They seem to spring up previously un-mentioned required meetings out of nowhere, and previously un-required blood tests that I have to now do, apparently. I've tried to contest this via emails because the pathway I chose only required 6 monthly meetings, and didn't require blood tests, as none of this was mentioned prior, but, we'll have to see how it goes.. and then on top of that they'd probably make me pay again for the prescription I've already paid for..

I was lead to believe by their communications and web design that I'd require a 6 monthly meeting, for a check up, and no blood tests. That's what I agreed to, and was how the first delivery of HRT was. But upon trying to get my first repeat, all hell broke lose. I'm willing to have a blood test if required, but, not to have one unnecessarily, and they have heavily mixed messages in this regard.

That's all I wanted to say. Just, trying my best to remain positive and shell out all my money and effort and time into following their demands (despite believing I had already done so).

Heck. When am I allowed to have my normal life back and not have to spend all day every day dealing with emails from this company and related companies?
