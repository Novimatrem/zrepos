I am being impersonated on Steam. The only real account for me is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Novimatrem/">https://steamcommunity.com/id/Novimatrem/</a> - any others are not I, zoey Globe, Novimatrem, and are instead those acting to defame and harass me.

Remember, my real username is EXACTLY Novimatrem - they have been using very similar typosquatted usernames. Verify, and be sure.
