I'm finding ways to work on my physical health, at the moment, that are compatible with who I am and the way I experience the world.

I might be away, sometimes. Other times, I may not.

This post isn't to say that I'm going anywhere, it's to state the fact that I could be, some days.

If I am away, I'm probably doing something that'll benefit my health, or is otherwise good for me.

Given the way the world is, it's not designed for somebody like me to make any positive progress, but I'm finding ways, forging paths, and will manage something, or at least the best I can.

If you come across anything that may be of help and isn't fatphobic in its writing or otherwise awful, please let me know.

Because a lot of sources of knowledge on these things seem to forget the idea that if you make the reader feel terrible, they're probably not going to bother with reading it.
