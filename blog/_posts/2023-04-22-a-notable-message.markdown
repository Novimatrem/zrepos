I apologise if the trolls around my profiles end up finding their way to yours, too. Transphobia isn't acceptable in my circles, nor are attempts to falsely ruin someone's reputation. 
I am fine with any genuine constructive criticism, I'm sure we all want to improve ourselves, but, this isn't what this is.
To the good people reading this: you deserve to feel comfortable, happy, and safe, in your social media experience- and if that means not being associated with me, in order to keep yourself safe from those who wish to attack me, then feel free- because I'd rather you be okay.
