Oh, hey there!

In no particular order, my intention in the coming while is to focus on the following:

â€¢ Poems<br>
â€¢ Stories<br>
â€¢ A text adventure game<br>
â€¢ YouTube videos<br>
â€¢ Further posts on the social-network-style things I use<br>
â€¢ More blog posts about notable life milestones<br>
â€¢ and just blog posts in general<br>

Just thought I'd let you know.

It may not end up being exactly as I've said, as I'm a little preoccupied recently with health, but, this is what I'd hope to work on having occur.

But for Now, I'm going to go play Halo.
