# Installation
Clone the contents of this repo into a folder where it will be safely accessible in the future; ``git clone https://gitlab.com/Novimatrem/hearing-protector-65-megapack``

I usually place it in; ``/opt/`` making the final path ``/opt/hearing-protector-65-megapack/``. 

**(If you've not already, you will need to take ownership of the ``/opt/`` folder before you can make edits there. To do so, use ``sudo chown $USER /opt/``, and ``sudo chown $USER /opt/*`` commands.)** 

Make a startup program using the "Startup Applications" GUI in which the command is ``bash /path/to/hearing-protector-65-megapack.sh`` (that command usually being ``bash /opt/hearing-protector-65-megapack/hearing-protector-65-megapack.sh``, then restart your computer.
