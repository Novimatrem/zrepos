# untitled-batch-game-engine (old, abandoned)

## abandoned batch text-adventure-game engine (alpha version)

Abandoned, archived, have your way with the remains (if you wish).
Released GNU GPL v2 due to past contributors being unaccessible for me to ask them if GPL v3 is okay to upgrade to.

Thank you for the friends, past and present, who have helped me with working on this, when I was very much into the development of it, you know who you are.

The engine is theoretically good enough, at this point, to just have more and more content added into it. As far as I can tell and think, it's complete enough to write a small adventure in.

This only works in Wine on Linux, in the Wine cmd.exe program.

You may experience lag due to a Wine regression that came-about at some point, sadly, it ran 100% fine before that.

**I wrote this when I was a bit younger, a teenager, don't judge it too badly.**
