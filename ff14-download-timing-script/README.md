# ff14-download-timing-script

This script makes it possible for me to download and update Final Fantasy 14, on my terrible internet.

It starts a download of FFXIV's demo application on Steam at 5 AM, and enters the password defined in the ahk file, to start the game downloading when nobody is using the internet, so it can happily steal all the bandwidth it wants.
(and yes, my router lacks QoS)
