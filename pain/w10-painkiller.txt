if worst comes to worst, and I must, this is what I do to make it slightly more bareable.

i'll add more to this over time, as i find them out, to combat their anti-user design methodology, and all that they do wrong.

if you don't want to do every step on this list, though you should, AT LEAST try out O&O ShutUp10, and the Ultimate Windows Tweaker, please.

= Misaligned mouse cursor fix
Go into the Mouse Properties screen, otherwise known as "Change Mouse Settings".
Go into the Pointer Options tab, and under 'Visibility' enable "Display Pointer Trails", and then set the Length to the lowest amount.
This turns your mouse into using Software-rendered mouse mode, which means it fixes the problem, and will now be accurate.

# Dark theme 100%
Go into the modern PC Settings app and do all you can to enable dark theme/dark mode as thoroughly as possible.
You can also find some settings for this by searching for 'dark' (in both settings' search, and the system's).
(don't go insane and enable the dark 'high contrast' theme, that's too far.)

then, in PowerShell x64 as Admin: 
Set-ItemProperty -Path HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Themes\Personalize -Name AppsUseLightTheme -Value 0

Be sure to of course set a desktop wallpaper + lockscreen/login screen image that is also dark.
The dark theme/dark mode support Windows provides is very incomplete. Especially in Windows 7. I heavily suggest, that on both Windows 7, and
Windows 10, that you use a custom Universal Theme Patcher/UxThemePatcher dark theme from DeviantArt, ON TOP OF these above tips, as it will
ensure that you have as close to 100% coverage as possible.
