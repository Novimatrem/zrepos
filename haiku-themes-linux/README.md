# haiku-themes-linux
Various 'Haiku' clone/very inspired/ripped themes & assets from across the internet. These were somewhat hard to find, very scattered, so I'll collect all I can here. Makes your Linux more Haiku-ish. Some may be obsolete. Used without permission.

I recommend using these files with and in the Xfce4 (Xfce) desktop, it seems to fit and look the best there, in my opinion- but they of course will work with almost every DE/WM.

# Screenshot of result
After applying and using these files, your system will look like the following, or very possibly even closer to how Haiku looks, depending on your knowledge of configuring your DE/WM, and how much you care to spend time adjusting it.

A matching Haiku (well, BeOS) look-alike Firefox theme can be found here: BeOS style by nuthatch https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/beos-style/
