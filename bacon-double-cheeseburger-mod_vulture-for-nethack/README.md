# Bacon double-cheeseburger mod for 'Vulture for Nethack'

Replaces the default sprites for the custom-nameable 'fruit' which defaults to 'slime mold', with a bacon double-cheeseburger, as that's what I have it named in [my .nethackrc](https://novimatrem.gitlab.io/nethackrc).

I recommend setting the ['fruit' variable](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Options#fruit) in ['.nethackrc'](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Options) to 'bacon double cheeseburger' when you're using this mod.

Obviously, due to how slime molds ('fruit') work, NetHack treats the fruit as vegan, regardless of its name or sprite.

As you should have changed your .nethackrc to name the fruit 'bacon double cheeseburger', the game will identify cheeseburger as the food part, so that quaffing certain potions results in messages such as "This tastes like cheeseburger juice".
