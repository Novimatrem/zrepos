personal-autosetup-linux-ubuntu - Automatically sets up the system as I prefer, ignore if you're not... me? - Licensed under the WTFPL v2. MILESTONE 7

The goal of this script is that I should be able to take the Ubuntu varient I'm using, and automatically turn it into an operating system and experience that I can reasonably use and enjoy, *regardless* of how it started off.
It removes stuff I don't want, adds stuff that I do, etc, etc.

I usually only test this with Xubuntu, as I only use Xubuntu. If you don't use Xubuntu, it may not work. YMMV.
(it should work fine on most Ubuntu's, though..)

Specifically, this is currently optimized for Xubuntu 21.04

On my laptop, this takes around 3.5 hours to install, and you have to babysit it.

The script does not work on Pop!_OS, due to issues that Pop!_OS has in removing GNOME on there.

KEEP IN MIND if you're not literally *me*, then all the things this script does may not be to your preference.

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND opening a Terminal and running ```ping 8.8.8.8``` in the background, alongside the Terminal window for this script, if you're paranoid about internet dropping during the process. Maybe that's just me. Of course, be sure to connect to your internet for this script to work, I connect to both my wired and wireless, as a fallback.

```wget https://novimatrem.uk/fast.sh && bash fast.sh```

MILESTONE 7!!
