# few-fedi-bot-diaspora-mac10-6

A #bot - remarkably enough in AppleScript for Mac OS X 10.6 - from Novimatrem. (@novimatrem@iviv.hu)

Inspired by bots such as “fuck every word”, posts a random word (from Apple’s Mac OS X 10.6 default English dictionary list), followed by the word “futa”, every 4 hours.

Posts once every 4 hours, to ‘All Aspects’ (so the posts are opt-in, by you adding this bot to an aspect).

To spread pride and awareness, and for funnies.

You MOST LIKELY do not want to run this yourself.
