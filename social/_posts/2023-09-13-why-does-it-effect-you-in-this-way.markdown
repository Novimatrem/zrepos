Why?

Why does it effect your life, in any way, the things I am, the things I do, and the choices I make.

Those things, they don't hurt anyone. They don't hurt me, nor anybody else.

The ways I identify, the things I do, the genders I love, even the things that I spend my time doing.

Everything is picked on, sometimes insulted.

So remember, before you start having a go at somebody for something, I simply do not understand why the thought doesn't cross your mind to consider:

Why does it effect you in this way? Does this thing actually impact your life in LITERALLY ANY NEGATIVE WAY?

If the answer is no, then, why bother causing an issue? Why be needlessly mean?

You know?
