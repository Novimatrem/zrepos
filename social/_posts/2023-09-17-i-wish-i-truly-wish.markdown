I truly wish I was able to forget my deadname.

I hope one day I will.

I don't know if that's even possible.

Memories come back from a DnD game I watched some of, where a character gave away memories in a ritual.

I wish I could choose to lose memories that I don't want.

Then again, perhaps that'd effect me negatively, through spirals of consequences, butterfly effect stuff.

But, yeah, anyway.

Truly wish I could forget my deadname.
