I don't know how much more clear I could've been with: "Please don't bring any negativity around me at the moment, I'm quite tired so it could actually manage to affect my mood", but, apparently that wasn't verbose enough.

I need to learn to just, close apps, shutdown devices, and leave a situation when it would negatively effect me, rather than allowing it to get far enough to frustrate me. 
I wish I wasn't such an attention deprived pushover sometimes, where just having someone around means I let them get away with more than I reasonably should, comfort wise.

Have to learn to state more boundaries for things that are not okay, that make me feel uncomfortable, sooner, and execute on them quicker when the situation arises. Though, there was a good couple of times I said that, this time.

Perhaps I just need to be less forgiving, but, that's not like me.

I don't know.

Feel free to reply with your thoughts, I guess.
