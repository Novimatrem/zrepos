i am a woman. my pronouns are she/her/hers.<br>
plain and simple, it’s a non-negotiable fact, and the truth.<br>
if you disagree, you’re wrong.<br>
this isn’t a discussion or a topic of debate.<br>

If anyone ever asks about me, this is what you say, because it's true.

If anyone ever gets it wrong, please correct them. 

Though, some decide to get it wrong maliciously on purpose, even if I directly correct them and make it abundantly clear. Assholes.
