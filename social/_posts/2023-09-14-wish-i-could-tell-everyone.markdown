Unfortunately, due to the situation I've been lead into when it comes to post-based social media sites, I was unable to let anybody know too-well that I was leaving to Novi Social specifically. I wasn't able to give much advance warning at all, and I wasn't able to post in some places to let others know full stop. It would  have been, and continues to just be too much of a risk for me.

If you know any of the creatures who used to follow me on Mastodon, Pleroma, ActivityPub, or diaspora, I'd strongly appreciate it if you'd let them know that I've moved over to <a href="https://novimatrem.uk/social/" target="_blank">https://novimatrem.uk/social/</a>- so that it's a little more active!

Spread the word if it wouldn't be too much trouble. Thank you.
