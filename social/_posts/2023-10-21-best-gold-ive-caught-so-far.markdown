``#notspon`` I've been really enjoying Call of the Wild: The Angler recently, relaxing but exciting fishing game.

Requires quite the beefy PC though unfortunately. I can run it pretty ok though, on Linux even. Oh, and it's a bit expensive, but my mom and step dad bought it me as a gift.

Goes somewhat in depth (pun unintended) for someone not experienced with fishing, but nothing too horrible to learn.

It also supports full cross play, so I've been fishing with my step dad when I can.

This is the best fish I've gotten in it so far, quite proud!

If you'd ever like to play it with me, let me know, I'd happily add you on Apex Connect and Steam.
